# PhisingDetection
Machine Learning Project
This application allows you to check if a website is likely phishing by analyzing its URL. 

**Features:**
* Enter a website URL.
* Select a prediction model (All, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost).
* Get a prediction on whether the website is classified as "Phishing" or "Benign".
* Optionally, see predictions from all three models.

**Requirements:**

* Python
* Streamlit library 
* Scikit-learn library 
* Pandas library 

**Note:**

* This is a basic example for educational purposes only. 
* Train your own phishing detection models on a relevant dataset before deployment in a real-world setting.
* This app should not be solely relied upon for real-world phishing detection.
